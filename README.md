Hi, I am Daniel Luna.
Im from Bolivia and I arrived to United States to finish my major in Computer Science. I started studying in Escuela Militar de Ingenieria. Now I am continuing my career at University of Illinois at Chicago.

I started loving Computer Science when I took html classes on high school and I got a lot of curiosity of what is behind of the apps we love using so much. In Escuela Militar de Ingenieria I learned my first programming language JAVA.

Now I look forward to graduate at University of Illinois Chicago where I learned different programming languages such as C, C++.

My best programming languages are C, C++, Java
